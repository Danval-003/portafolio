## 👤 About Me

Introduce yourself with a concise bio that highlights your background, motivations, and values([FreeCodeCamp][1]).
I grew up in a rural region of Guatemala, where I learned that collaboration, empathy, and a passion for sharing knowledge can transform communities. This belief guided me to lead human-centered projects like **Alfabetizate**, bringing digital literacy tools to underserved areas, and **Explorax**, an edutainment app blending curiosity and play to teach scientific and cultural concepts.
